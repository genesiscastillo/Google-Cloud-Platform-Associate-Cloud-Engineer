### Cloud Run (fully managed)
The Cloud Run (fully managed) platform allows you to deploy stateless containers without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. Your workloads are automatically scaled out or in to zero depending on the traffic to your app. You only pay when your app is running, billed to the nearest 100 milliseconds.

### Cloud Run for Anthos
Cloud Run for Anthos abstracts away complex Kubernetes concepts, allowing developers to easily leverage the benefits of Kubernetes and serverless together. It provides access to custom machine types, additional networking support, and Cloud Accelerators. It allows you to run your workloads on-premises or on Google Cloud.
